abstract = {In this paper, we employed a segmented Poisson model to analyze the available daily new cases data of the COVID-19 outbreaks in the six Western countries of the Group of Seven, namely, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, UK and USA. We incorporated the governments interventions (stay-at-home advises/orders, lockdowns, quarantines and social distancing) against COVID-19 into consideration. Our analysis allowed us to make a statistical prediction on the turning point (the time that the daily new cases peak), the duration (the period that the outbreak lasts) and the attack rate (the percentage of the total population that will be infected over the course of the outbreak) for these countries.}

abstract = {Objectives
Ecuador is among the worst-hit countries in the world by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In terms of confirmed deaths per million inhabitants, as of October 22, Ecuador ranks fourth in the Americas and ninth worldwide according to data from the World Health Organization. In this report, we estimate excess deaths due to any cause in Ecuador since the start of the lockdown measures on March 17, 2020 until October 22, 2020.
Methods
Estimates of excess deaths were calculated as the difference between the number of observed deaths from all causes and estimates of expected deaths from all causes. Expected deaths were estimated for the period March 17 October 22, 2020 from forecasts of an ARIMA model of order (3,0,1) with drift which was applied to daily mortality data for the period from January 1, 2014 to March 16, 2020.
Results
The number of all-cause excess deaths in Ecuador was estimated to be 36,922 (95% bootstrap confidence interval: 32,31442,696) during the study period. The peak in all-cause excess mortality in Ecuador may have occurred on April 4, 2020, with 909 excess deaths.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that the real impact of the pandemic in Ecuador was much worse than that indicated by reports from national institutions. Estimates of excess mortality might provide a better approximation of the true COVID-19 death toll. These estimates might capture not only deaths directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic but also deaths from other diseases that resulted from indirect effects of the pandemic.}

abstract = {The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic affecting many countries, including Singapore. Previous studies have investigated the relationship of air pollutant levels and meteorological factors with respiratory disease risk and hospital admission rates. However, associations between air pollutant concentrations and meteorological factors with COVID-19 infection have been equivocal. This study aimed to assess the association between core air pollutant concentrations, meteorological variables and daily confirmed COVID-19 case numbers in Singapore. Data on air pollutant levels (particulate matter [PM2.5, PM10], ozone [O3], carbon monoxide [CO], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], sulphur dioxide [SO2], pollutant standards index [PSI]) and meteorological factors (rainfall, humidity, temperature) was obtained from the Singapore National Environment Agency (NEA) from January 23, 2020 to April 6, 2020. The daily reported COVID-19 case numbers were retrieved from the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH). Generalized linear models with Poisson family distribution and log-link were used to estimate the model coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between air pollutant concentrations and meteorological factors (8-day and 15-day moving averages (MA)) with COVID-19 case numbers, adjusting for humidity, rainfall and day of week. We observed significantly positive associations between NO2, PSI, PM2.5 and temperature with COVID-19 case numbers. Every 1-unit increase (15-day MA) in PSI, 1Î¼g/m3 increase (15-day MA) in PM2.5, NO2 and 0.1ÂÂ°C increase in temperature were significantly associated with a 35.0% (95% CI: 29.7%â40.5%), 22.6% (95% CI: 12.0%â34.3%), 34.8% (95% CI: 29.3%40.4%) and 28.6% (95% CI: 25.0%32.4%) increase in the average daily number of COVID-19 cases respectively. On the contrary, PM10, O3, SO2, CO, rainfall and humidity were significantly associated with lower average daily numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Similar associations were observed for the 8-day MAs. Future studies could explore the long-term consequences of the air pollutants on COVID-19 infection and recovery.}
